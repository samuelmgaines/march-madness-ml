# March Madness ML Algorithm (In Development)

## Project Description

In this personal project, I train a machine learning model to make men's March Madness predictions based on historical data from past college basketball seasons. Development is currently in progress.

## Set Up

Nothing here as of yet.

## Data

### March Madness History

Data from previous March Madness tournaments (1985 - 2019) comes from [here](https://data.world/michaelaroy/ncaa-tournament-results). This data has been downloaded and can be found in `data/mm-results.csv`. A few column names have been altered for uniqueness and clarity.

### Seasonal Stats
Team stats from each season are pulled from [SportsReference](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb).
